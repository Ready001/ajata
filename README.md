# My Portfolio Website

## Hosted at: [https://ready001.github.io/ajata/](https://ready001.github.io/ajata/)

This is my personal portfolio website built to showcase my projects and skills. It is made with React, Typescript, Node, and Sass.

Libraries used:

- [react-type-animation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-type-animation)
- [react-timeline-animation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-timeline-animation)

## Features on this website

### Skills Section Search Function
Implemented intelligent filter algorithms in the skills section that consider related words, enabling users to find relevant skills beyond exact matches. For example, searching for "java" will also display its associated libraries and frameworks. It also allows users to explore skills related to specific topics like computer vision and discover related skills.

### Accessibility
Ensured accessibility by following best design practices, including providing useful alt text for all images. This enhances the accessibility of the website for individuals who use screen readers. Additionally, all links that use onClick to navigate instead of href are designed as buttons, making it more accessible for keyboard users.

### Responsiveness
The website is meticulously designed to be highly responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices. It adapts beautifully to different screen sizes and resolutions, providing an optimal viewing experience for all users.
